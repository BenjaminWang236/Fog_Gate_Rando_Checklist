# Progression Tracking Checklist for Elden Ring: Fog Gate Randomizer mod

v0.1.5

Up-to-date with the Fog Gate Randomizer v1.4

Include the Multiplayer Limit Fog Gates added exclusively by the mod made by TheFifthMatt

This checklist is generated by data-mining the Fog Gate Randomizer mod, Matt and Matt alone is to blame for all esoteric descriptions.

## Usage

1. (Optional) Make a copy of the **Elden_Ring_Fog_Rando_Checklist_v0_1_5_Master.xlsx** Excel Spreadsheet checklist
2. Open the (copied) checklist, go to the Tab at the bottom that matches your Fog Gate Randomizer setting
   1. For Dungeon Crawl mode, which excludes the overworld, choose any of the tab starting with "Dungeon Crawl"
   2. For World Shuffle mode, which includes the overworld, choose any of the tab starting with "World Shuffle"
3. Choose the numbering at the end of each Tab's name indicating the number of selected options for included areas/fog gates
   1. Make sure the checklist setting matches your Fog Gate Randomizer setting
4. Each Fog Gate is sorted into its Region, and detailed (relatively speaking) description can be found in its associated Description
   1. Be warned that TheFifthMatt (mod developer)'s description can be quite esoteric half of the time, some experience may be required to decipher them.
5. While playing the game, keep track of your Progression by:
   1. Leave yet-to-be-found fog gates as FALSE (no highlighting)
   2. Mark the found but not yet explored or work-in-progress/saved for later fog gates as WIP (highlighted in Orange)
   3. Mark the found AND explored fog gates as TRUE (highlighted in Green)
6. Have Fun!
